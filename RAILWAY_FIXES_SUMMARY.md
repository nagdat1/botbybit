# Railway Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve the deployment issues encountered on Railway.

## Issues Identified

1. **Port Conflict**: Both Flask applications were trying to use the same port (8080)
2. **Event Loop Error**: `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` when starting the Telegram bot

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution

**Problem**: 
```
Address already in use
Port 8080 is in use by another program.
```

**Solution**: 
- Modified [app.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/app.py) to use Railway's provided `PORT` environment variable for the main Flask app
- Modified [web_server.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/web_server.py) to use `WEBHOOK_PORT` environment variable (defaults to 5000) for the web server
- This ensures both applications use different ports

**Files Modified**:
- [app.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/app.py) - Line 162: `port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))`
- [web_server.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/web_server.py) - Line 370: `port = int(os.environ.get('WEBHOOK_PORT', 5000))`

### 2. Event Loop Error Resolution

**Problem**:
```
RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
```

**Solution**:
- Replaced `application.run_polling()` with `asyncio.run(application.run_polling())` in [app.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/app.py)
- This properly manages the asyncio event loop in a separate thread

**Files Modified**:
- [app.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/app.py) - Line 127: `asyncio.run(application.run_polling(allowed_updates=['message', 'callback_query']))`

### 3. Configuration Updates

**Files Modified**:
- [config.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/config.py) - Updated to properly handle Railway URLs and ports
- [web_server.py](file:///C:/Users/nagda/OneDrive/Desktop/1/web_server.py) - Updated to use proper port configuration

## Verification

The fixes have been verified using `test_fixes.py`:

✅ Port configuration properly separates main app (PORT) and webhook server (WEBHOOK_PORT)
✅ Asyncio fix is implemented correctly using `asyncio.run()`
✅ All required environment variables are documented for Railway setup

## Railway Dashboard Configuration

In your Railway project dashboard, set these environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| PORT | 8080 | Main application port (provided by Railway) |
| WEBHOOK_PORT | 5000 | Webhook server port |
| TELEGRAM_TOKEN | your_token | Your Telegram bot token |
| ADMIN_USER_ID | your_id | Your Telegram user ID |
| BYBIT_API_KEY | your_key | Your Bybit API key |
| BYBIT_API_SECRET | your_secret | Your Bybit API secret |

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. Main Flask app will run on port 8080 (Railway's provided PORT)
2. Webhook server will run on port 5000 (WEBHOOK_PORT)
3. Telegram bot will start without event loop errors
4. Webhook URLs will be properly configured using Railway's domain
5. No port conflicts should occur

## Additional Notes

- The warnings about Werkzeug development server are normal for Railway deployments and can be ignored
- All configuration is now environment-variable driven for better cloud deployment compatibility
- The application will automatically adapt to Railway's environment variables
