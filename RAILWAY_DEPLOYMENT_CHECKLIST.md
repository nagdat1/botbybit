# Railway Deployment Checklist

This document summarizes all the changes made to make the project ready for Railway deployment.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Railway Configuration Files
- `railway.yaml` - Main Railway configuration
- `railway.toml` - Additional Railway settings with environment variables
- `Dockerfile` - Updated to use Railway's PORT environment variable

### 2. Application Code Updates
- `config.py` - Updated to handle Railway URLs and environment variables
- `run_with_server.py` - Updated to use Railway's PORT and send notifications
- `web_server.py` - Updated to handle Railway URLs and notifications

### 3. Documentation
- `README.md` - Added Railway deployment instructions and features
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### 4. Helper Files
- `test_railway_env.py` - Script to test Railway environment variables
- `test_railway.py` - Script to verify Railway readiness
- `health.py` - Simple health check endpoint

## Key Changes Made

### Environment Variable Handling
- The application now properly uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- Webhook URLs are automatically configured using `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` or `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL`
- All configuration now respects Railway's environment variables
- Added fallback support for multiple Railway URL formats

### Notification System
- Added automatic Telegram notifications when the bot starts on Railway
- Sends webhook URL to admin via Telegram
- Displays environment type (Railway Cloud, Render Cloud, or Local)
- Enhanced console output with clear webhook URL display

### Docker Support
- Updated Dockerfile to work with Railway's build system
- Properly exposes the PORT provided by Railway
- Uses gunicorn as the production server

### Health Checks
- Added `/health` endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- Configured health check in Railway deployment settings

## Deployment Steps

1. Push the updated code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new project on Railway.app
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" and choose your repository
4. In the Railway dashboard, set the following environment variables:
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` - Your Telegram bot token
   - `ADMIN_USER_ID` - Your Telegram user ID
   - `BYBIT_API_KEY` - Your Bybit API key
   - `BYBIT_API_SECRET` - Your Bybit API secret
5. Deploy the application

## Verification

Run these commands to verify Railway readiness:
```bash
# Test environment variables
python test_railway_env.py

# Test general Railway readiness
python test_railway.py
```

## Expected Behavior on Railway

1. **Startup**: The bot will start and bind to Railway's provided PORT
2. **URL Detection**: Automatically detect Railway's public domain
3. **Telegram Notification**: Send webhook URL to admin via Telegram
4. **Console Output**: Display clear webhook URL in console logs
5. **Webhook Ready**: Accept TradingView signals at `/webhook` endpoint

## Notes

- The application will automatically bind to the PORT provided by Railway
- Webhook URLs will be automatically configured using Railway's domain
- Health checks are performed on the `/health` endpoint
- The application uses gunicorn for production deployment
- **Important**: The bot will send you the webhook URL via Telegram when it starts on Railway
