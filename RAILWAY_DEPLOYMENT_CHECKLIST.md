## Key Changes Made

### Environment Variable Handling
- The application now properly uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- Webhook URLs are automatically configured based on Railway's provided URL
- All configuration now respects Railway's environment variables

### Docker Support
- Updated Dockerfile to work with Railway's build system
- Properly exposes the PORT provided by Railway
- Uses gunicorn as the production server

### Health Checks
- Added `/health` endpoint for Railway health monitoring
- Configured health check in Railway deployment settings

## Deployment Steps

1. Push the updated code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new project on Railway.app
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" and choose your repository
4. In the Railway dashboard, set the following environment variables:
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` - Your Telegram bot token
   - `ADMIN_USER_ID` - Your Telegram user ID
   - `BYBIT_API_KEY` - Your Bybit API key
   - `BYBIT_API_SECRET` - Your Bybit API secret
5. Deploy the application

## Verification

Run `python test_railway.py` to verify that all required files are present and the project is ready for deployment.

## Notes

- The application will automatically bind to the PORT provided by Railway
- Webhook URLs will be automatically configured using Railway's domain
- Health checks are performed on the `/health` endpoint
- The application uses gunicorn for production deployment
